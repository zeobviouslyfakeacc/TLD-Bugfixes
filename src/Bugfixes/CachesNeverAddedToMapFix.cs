	 * The MapDetail of a prepper cache is supposed to be added to the map after it
	 * has been discovered by a player (i.e. the player climbed down the hatch).
	 *
	 * However, this doesn't happen because PlayerManager#InteractiveObjectsProcessInteraction
	 * only looks for MapDetails in the children of m_InteractiveObjectUnderCrosshair.
	 *
	 * In the case of caches, the game object holding the MapDetail component is a parent
	 * of the game object with the collider (assigned to m_InteractiveObjectUnderCrosshair).
	 *
	 * Actually, PlayerManager#InteractiveObjectsProcessInteraction never even looks for MapDetails
	 * in the prepper cache objects at all because it immediately returns false when encountering
	 * a game object with a LoadScene component.
	 *
	 * Both of these bugs would need to be fixed for caches to appear on players' maps again.
